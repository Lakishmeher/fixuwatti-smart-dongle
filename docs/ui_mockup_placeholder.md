# UI Mockup Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the UI mockup image (ui_mockup.png).

To add the actual UI mockup:
1. Create a mockup of the M5Stack Core2 display interface using tools like:
   - Figma
   - Draw.io
   - Adobe XD
   - Or draw by hand and scan/photograph

2. The mockup should show:
   - FixuWattiâ„¢ logo at the top
   - Connection status indicator (colored circle)
   - Current relay state (ON/OFF)
   - Electricity price display
   - SOC (State of Charge) percentage
   - Mode indicator (AUTO/MAN)
   - Three buttons (A, B, C) at the bottom

3. Replace this file with your actual PNG image named "ui_mockup.png"

Recommended image dimensions: 320x240 pixels (M5Stack Core2 native resolution) or higher for documentation purposes.
